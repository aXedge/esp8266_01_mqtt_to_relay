## Details required:

Fill the following details for connecting to the WiFi router (at your home):

- `WLAN_SSID`
- `WLAN_PASS`

As this is a Demo project, I have used AdaFruit IO's Feeds as the MQTT Broker to communicate with the Device.
(see https://accounts.adafruit.com).  

You will need the following details of your AdaFruit IO (AIO) account:

- `AIO_USERNAME`
- `AIO_KEY`                     <= This can be accessed/generated from: https://io.adafruit.com/<`AIO_USERNAME`>/dashboards (look for the "My Key" tab on the menubar).
- `AIO_MQTT_FEED_ONOFFBUTTON`   <= The name of the feed to which the Device should subscribe (would start with something like "/feeds/<`FEED_NAME`>").
